Here I tried to implement how Caesar Cipher encrypts and decrypts which was implemented in the code, it was through leftshift and rightshift the letter.Moreover, how the code of Substitution Cipher was implemented that shows how a encrypted paragraph can be decrypted through observing the frequency table and thorugh trail and error technique.
